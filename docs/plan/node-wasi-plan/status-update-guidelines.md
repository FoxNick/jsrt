# Status Update Guidelines

## Three-Level Status Tracking System

This plan uses a three-level status tracking system for clarity:

### Level 1: Document-Level Status (Task Metadata)

Shows overall plan status:
- ðŸŸ¡ PLANNING - Initial planning and research phase
- ðŸ”µ IN_PROGRESS - Actively working on implementation
- ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED - All tasks complete, validated, documented
- ðŸ”´ BLOCKED - Blocked by critical issues

### Level 2: Phase-Level Status (Org-mode Properties)

Each phase tracks its own progress:
- :STATUS: (Same color codes as document level)
- :PROGRESS: X/Y (completed tasks / total tasks)
- :COMPLETION: N% (percentage complete)

### Level 3: Task-Level Status (Org-mode Keywords)

Individual task states using Org-mode TODO keywords:
- TODO - Not yet started
- IN-PROGRESS - Currently working on this
- BLOCKED - Cannot proceed due to dependencies/issues
- DONE - Task completed successfully
- CANCELLED - Task no longer needed

## Update Discipline

### MANDATORY Updates

Update the plan document IMMEDIATELY when:
1. Task starts â†’ Change TODO to IN-PROGRESS, log start time
2. Task completes â†’ Change to DONE, update phase progress
3. Task blocked â†’ Change to BLOCKED, document issue in History
4. Phase completes â†’ Update phase status and completion %
5. Scope changes â†’ Add/modify tasks, log in History

### Update Frequency

- After EVERY significant state change (not in batches)
- Real-time updates as work progresses
- Timestamp all changes using ISO 8601 format
