** Document Information
- *Created*: 2025-10-16T10:00:00Z
- *Last Updated*: 2025-10-16T10:00:00Z
- *Status*: üîµ IN-PROGRESS
- *Overall Progress*: 0/15 tasks (0%)
- *Test Status*: 198/200 passing (99%)

* üìã Executive Summary

** Current Status

*** Test Results
- *Tests Passing*: 198/200 (99%)
- *Tests Failing*: 2 tests
  - test_stream_incoming.js (Test #9: POST body streaming)
  - test_stream_advanced.js (Test #2: IncomingMessage readable state)

*** Phase Completion
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ DONE (100%) - Modular refactoring complete
- Phase 2: üü° 97% (29/30) - Missing keep-alive connection reuse
- Phase 3: ‚úÖ DONE (100%) - Client implementation complete
- Phase 4: üü° 72% (18/25) - Core streaming done, advanced optional
- Phase 5: üü° 68% (17/25) - Timeouts done, some optional
- Phase 6: ‚úÖ DONE (100%) - Testing complete
- Phase 7: ‚ö™ 0% (0/10) - Documentation (can defer)

*** Critical Blocker
**POST Request Body Handling Bug**
- *Symptom*: Server never receives response after client sends POST data
- *Impact*: Blocks 2 tests from passing
- *Root Cause*: IncomingMessage 'end' event not emitted properly after body data
- *Location*: src/node/http/http_parser.c:on_message_complete(), http_incoming.c

** Objective
Complete the remaining 2% of mandatory HTTP module implementation to achieve 100% test pass rate and production-ready core HTTP server/client functionality.

** Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ 200/200 tests passing (100%)
- ‚úÖ POST body streaming works correctly
- ‚úÖ Keep-alive connection reuse implemented
- ‚úÖ All mandatory Phase 2-5 tasks completed
- ‚úÖ make format && make test && make wpt all pass
- ‚úÖ Zero memory leaks (ASAN validation)
- ‚úÖ Plan document updated with three-level status tracking

* üîç Root Cause Analysis: POST Body Bug

** Problem Statement
Test #9 in test_stream_incoming.js sends a POST request with body data. The server handler sets up 'data' and 'end' event listeners on the IncomingMessage (req). However:
1. Client sends POST data via req.write() and req.end()
2. Server's 'data' event fires (receives body chunks)
3. Server's 'end' event NEVER fires
4. Server never calls res.end('OK')
5. Client hangs waiting for response
6. Test times out after 3 seconds

** Current Implementation Analysis

*** on_body() Callback (http_parser.c:490-504)
```c
int on_body(llhttp_t* parser, const char* at, size_t length) {
  JSHttpConnection* conn = (JSHttpConnection*)parser->data;

  // Phase 4: Stream data to IncomingMessage instead of buffering
  if (!JS_IsUndefined(conn->current_request)) {
    js_http_incoming_push_data(conn->ctx, conn->current_request, at, length);
  }

  // Also keep accumulating for backwards compatibility (_body property)
  if (buffer_append(&conn->body_buffer, &conn->body_size,
                    &conn->body_capacity, at, length) != 0) {
    return -1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
- ‚úÖ Correctly calls js_http_incoming_push_data() to emit 'data' events
- ‚úÖ Works: Server receives body data

*** on_message_complete() Callback (http_parser.c:507-553)
```c
int on_message_complete(llhttp_t* parser) {
  JSHttpConnection* conn = (JSHttpConnection*)parser->data;
  JSContext* ctx = conn->ctx;

  // Set body on request if any (backwards compatibility)
  if (conn->body_buffer && conn->body_size > 0) {
    JSValue body_str = JS_NewStringLen(ctx, conn->body_buffer, conn->body_size);
    JS_SetPropertyStr(ctx, conn->current_request, "_body", body_str);
  }

  // Phase 4: Signal end of stream to IncomingMessage
  if (!JS_IsUndefined(conn->current_request)) {
    js_http_incoming_end(ctx, conn->current_request);
  }

  // ... rest of code ...
  return 0;
}
```
- ‚úÖ Correctly calls js_http_incoming_end() to emit 'end' event
- ‚ùì But 'end' event is not reaching JavaScript listener

*** js_http_incoming_end() (http_incoming.c)
Need to check this function's implementation for issues.

** Hypothesis
The 'end' event emission in js_http_incoming_end() may have one of these issues:
1. Event not emitted at all
2. Event emitted before listener is attached
3. readableEnded state not set correctly
4. Event emitter inheritance broken for IncomingMessage

** Debugging Steps Required
1. ‚úÖ Read http_incoming.c to check js_http_incoming_end() implementation
2. Add debug logging to trace 'end' event emission
3. Verify event listener attachment timing
4. Check readableEnded property state transitions
5. Test with debug build: make jsrt_g && ./bin/jsrt_g test/...

  Started work on HTTP module completion plan
- Note taken on [2025-10-16 10:00] \\
  Created comprehensive plan for completing final 2% of HTTP implementation
:END:

** [2025-10-16 10:00] Plan Created
- Analyzed current test failures (2/200 tests failing)
- Identified root cause: POST body 'end' event not emitted
- Created dependency-ordered task breakdown
- Ready to begin Phase 0: Critical Bug Fix

* üîÆ Future Work (Optional Features)

- Advanced streaming features
- Stream transformation support
- Backpressure handling enhancements

** Phase 5 Optional Tasks (TBD after Phase 2.2 analysis)
- HTTPS full implementation (requires OpenSSL integration)
- Advanced timeout configurations (maxHeadersCount, headersTimeout, requestTimeout)
- Server-side upgrades (WebSocket protocol switching)
- Trailer headers support

** Performance Optimizations
- Connection pool optimization
- Header parsing optimization
- Buffer management tuning
- Zero-copy optimizations where possible

** Additional Testing
- Stress testing (1000+ concurrent connections)
- Long-running stability tests
- Edge case coverage expansion
- Fuzzing integration

* üìù Notes

** Design Decisions

*** Three-Level Status Tracking
To improve plan maintainability and visibility, we track progress at three levels:
1. *Phase Level*: Overall phase completion (e.g., "Phase 2: 30/30 tasks")
2. *Task Level*: Individual task completion (e.g., "Task 2.2: 4/4 subtasks")
3. *Subtask Level*: Granular checklist items (e.g., "‚úÖ Implement socket pool")

This provides:
- Clear visibility into what's done vs remaining
- Easy identification of blocking tasks
- Better estimation of remaining work

*** Focus on Core Functionality
The plan prioritizes core HTTP server/client functionality required for production use:
- ‚úÖ Request/response handling
- ‚úÖ Streaming (data/end events)
- ‚úÖ Keep-alive connection reuse
- ‚úÖ Timeouts
- ‚ùå HTTPS (requires OpenSSL - deferred)
- ‚ùå WebSocket upgrades (advanced - deferred)
- ‚ùå Advanced headers (nice-to-have - deferred)

*** Dependency-Ordered Execution
Tasks are ordered to maximize parallel execution while respecting dependencies:
- Phase 0 (bug fix) blocks all other work
- Phase 1 (keep-alive) can start after Phase 0
- Phase 2 (assessment) runs in parallel after Phase 1
- Phase 3 (docs) runs in parallel with Phase 2
- Phase 4 (validation) runs last after all work complete
